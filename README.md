# DS200: Research Methods
## Module 4: Literature Review and Software Tooling

## Data

The data contains Category-wise All India automobile production from 2001-02 to 2014-15. Data is obtained from <https://data.gov.in/resources/category-wise-all-india-automobile-production-2001-02-2014-15>

## Plots

### Scatter Plot

![Production of different kinds of Vehicles](scatter%20plot.png)

**Observation**:\
From the scatter plot, I observe that the Production of Passenger Vehicles is more compared to Commercial Vehicles. There is a linear relationship between both vehicles with a total number of vehicles.

### Box Plot

#### With Outliers
![Vehicle Production in 4 years](box%20plot%20outliers.png)

#### Without Outliers
![Vehicle Production in 4 years](box%20plot.png)

**Observation**:\
Box plot contains data of 4 years. In the plot without outliers, the distribution of production of every vehicle taken into account is uniform. It means all vehicles are produced uniformly. But in case of with outlier plot, we observe that two particular kinds of vehicles are produced more compared to all vehicles.

### Bar Plot

![Vehicle Production over years](bar%20plot.png)

**Observation**:\
From the bar plot, it is clear that production is vehicles is increasing annually.
